Is it possible to add a login page and then create a different RSVP and Different Sections depending on who has logged in. There will be 3 different types of guests they will have their own email login identifier and will either belong to group 1000, 2000 or 3000. I will provide a (CRM-like) Spreadsheet lookup for this
In the gallery section, in the text. I want to make 'HERE' a hyperlink, for now just direct it to www.google.com then I can Edit later
Can you reformat this:
<div class="mb-6">
                        <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">Donations</h4>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Truly, your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift of all. However, if you'd like to contribute to our honeymoon, please use the links below:
                            
                        PAYPAL
                        MONZO
                        BANK TRANSFER </p>

So Paypal, Monzo and Bank Statement appear on new lines and can you make them hyperlinks and underlined. For now, each can go to www.google.com
This: 
<a href="#photos" class="nav-link text-gray-700 hover:text-be3144 transition duration-300">Photos</a>

In the hero section add a text field between the countdown and the RSVP button that will be used as a field for user to enter their unique login code. Please add the text saying 'Enter your code here'
Increase opacity of the following box to match the countdown items

<div class="mb-8 w-full max-w-xs mx-auto">
